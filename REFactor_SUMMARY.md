# Refactor Summary

## Scope
- Surface backend-provided assignment metadata and evaluation aggregates in the React workflow for improved operator feedback.
- Tighten evaluation persistence by relying on conflict-aware upserts while exposing richer analytics to the frontend.
- Capture end-to-end trade-offs, validation steps, and suggested extensions for the Besimple AI Judge challenge.

## Key changes
1. **Evaluation analytics (backend)**
   - Added reusable filter application inside `evaluation_service.fetch_evaluations`.
   - Calculated `pass_count` and `pass_rate` per request so the UI can display queue-level pass metrics.
2. **Queue assignments (frontend)**
   - `useQueue` now preserves the assignment summary returned by the backend.
   - Queue page renders a banner summarizing saved assignments and expected evaluation volume.
3. **Runner monitoring (frontend)**
   - `useRunner` consumes `expected_evaluations` and `completed_evaluations` outputs to seed progress totals and live status copy.
   - Status messaging clearly communicates how many evaluations finished out of the expected total.
4. **Results analytics (frontend)**
   - `useResults` stores aggregate pass counts.
   - Results page headline shows "Pass rate: X% (Y of Z)" using backend data rather than page-level slices.

## Validation
- `python -m compileall server/app/services/evaluation_service.py`
- `npm run build` (frontend)

## Trade-offs & follow-ups
- Attachments, prompt field toggles, and analytics charts remain documented TODOs (see README) because they require schema or design expansions.
- Monitoring still leans on Supabase polling fallback; introducing WebSocket/SQS infrastructure would harden production readiness.
- Consider adding unit tests for `evaluation_service` filters using Supabase mocks when time allows.
